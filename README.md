# Mee Node Deployment Guide

This repository contains the necessary configuration files to deploy and run a Mee Node. This guide will walk you through the setup process and provide information about node maintenance.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Access to RPC endpoints for the chains you want to support
- Sufficient funds in native tokens for the supported chains

## Setting Up a Node

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcnmy/mee-node-deployment
cd mee-node-deployment
```

### 2. Configure Chain RPC URLs

1. Navigate to the appropriate chains folder:
   - `chains-prod/` for mainnet networks
   - `chains-testnet/` for testnet networks

2. For each chain you want to support, create a JSON file with the RPC configuration.

> **Note**: For mainnet node operators, it's recommended to support all 9 mainnet networks from the `chains-prod` folder.

### 3. Configure Docker Compose

1. Open `docker-compose.yml` and ensure the volumes section points to your chosen chains folder:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./chains-testnet:/app/chains  # Change to chains-prod for mainnet
   ```

2. You can support both mainnet and testnet by adding JSON files to the loaded chains folder.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following minimum configuration:

```env
KEY=<your-private-key>
PORT=3000
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

> **Note**: If you're using your own Redis instance, update `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` accordingly.

### 5. Fund Your Node

Ensure your node's private key address is funded with sufficient native tokens on all supported chains. Recommended minimum funding:

| Chain | Minimum Native Token |
|-------|---------------------|
| ETH-based chains | 0.05 ETH |
| Gnosis Chain | 100 xDAI |
| BSC | 0.17 BNB |
| Sonic Chain | 50 S |
| Polygon | 500 POL |
| Avax C-Chain | 5 AVAX |

### 6. Start the Node

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Upon successful startup, you should see logs indicating:
- Node initialization
- Chain health checks
- Simulator status

## Additional Configuration Options

The following environment variables can be added to your `.env` file for additional configuration:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FEE_BENEFICIARY` | Address that collects node fees | Node's private key address |
| `FEE_PERCENTAGE` | Percentage added to gas fees | 10 |
| `GATEWAY_URL` | Biconomy Network URL | Required for mainnet |
| `ENV_ENC_PASSWORD` | Password for encrypted key file | - |
| `USEROP_MIN_EXEC_WINDOW_DURATION` | Minimum execution window (seconds) | 180 |
| `USEROP_MAX_EXEC_WINDOW_DURATION` | Maximum execution window (seconds) | 600 |
| `USEROP_MAX_WAIT_BEFORE_EXEC_START` | Maximum future execution time (seconds) | 300 |
| `USEROP_TRACE_CALL_SIMULATION_POLL_INTERVAL` | Simulation check interval (seconds) | 2 |
| `USEROP_SAFE_WINDOW_BEFORE_EXEC_END` | Early execution threshold (seconds) | 30 |
| `MAX_CALLDATA_GAS_LIMIT` | Maximum calldata gas limit | 330000001 |

## Loading Encrypted Private Key

Instead of providing the raw private key, you can use an encrypted key file:

1. Install the ChainLink env-enc package:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @chainlink/env-enc
   ```

2. Generate encrypted key:
   ```bash
   npx env-enc set-pw
   npx env-enc set
   ```
   When prompted, enter "KEY" as the variable name and your private key as the value.

3. Rename the generated file to `key.enc` and place it in the `./keystore` folder.

4. In your `.env` file, replace the `KEY` variable with:
   ```env
   ENV_ENC_PASSWORD=<your-encryption-password>
   ```

## Node Maintenance

### Monitoring Node Health

1. Check the node status endpoint:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/v3/info
   ```

2. Monitor chain health status in the response. A healthy chain status looks like:
   ```json
   {
     "chainId": "11155420",
     "name": "OP Sepolia",
     "healthCheck": {
       "rpcOperational": true,
       "debugTraceCallSupported": true,
       "nativeBalance": "528841195784636675",
       "nonce": 5055,
       "execQueueActiveJobs": 0,
       "execQueuePendingJobs": 0,
       "lastChecked": 1743538429111,
       "status": "healthy"
     }
   }
   ```

### Balance Management

1. Regularly monitor native token balances across all supported chains
2. Swap earned ERC20 tokens for native tokens when needed
3. Maintain sufficient funding for gas fees

### Troubleshooting

If a chain shows unhealthy status:
```json
{
  "chainId": "421614",
  "name": "Arbitrum Sepolia",
  "healthCheck": {
    "status": "not-healthy",
    "reason": "native coin balance too low"
  }
}
```

Take appropriate action based on the reported reason:
- Add more native tokens if balance is low
- Check RPC connectivity if RPC is not operational
- Review execution queue if jobs are stuck
